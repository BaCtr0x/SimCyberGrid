The [[Gateway]] utilizes the services of a Security Module as a cryptographic service provider for different cryptographic functionalities based on elliptic curve cryptography as the generation and verification of digital signatures and key agreement which is used by the Gateway in the framework of TLS, content data signature and content data encryption. The Security Module contains the cryptographic identity of the Gateway, and it serves as a reliable source for random numbers as well as secure storage for cryptographic keys and certificates. The Security module is addressed within this Protection Profile, It is embedded into the Gateway and directly communicates with the Gateway.
