The Gateway serves as the communication component between the components in the LAN of the consumer and the outside world. It can be seen as a special kind of firewall dedicated to the Smart Metering functionality. It also collects, processes and stores the records from Meter(s) and ensures that only authorised parties have access to them or derivatives thereof. Before sending relevant information7 the information will be signed and encrypted using the services of the TOE. The Gateway features a mandatory user interface, enabling authorised consumers to access the data relevant to them. The Gateways will be evaluated separately according to the requirements in the corresponding Protection Profile
