The Meter itself records the consumption or production of one or more commodities (e.g. electricity, gas, water, heat) in defined intervals and submits those records to the [[Gateway]]. The Meter Data has to be signed before transfer in order to ensure their authenticity and integrity. The Meter is comparable to a classical meter and has comparable security requirements; it will be sealed as classical meters are today according to the regulations of [PTB_A50.7]. The Meter further supports the encryption of its connection to the Gateway.
