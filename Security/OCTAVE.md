Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) is a comprehensive, asset-driven risk assessment methodology focused on identifying, evaluating, and managing information security risks at an organizational level. It is designed to be self-directed, meaning a team within the organization—typically a mix of business and IT personnel—carries out the assessment, ensuring that the process aligns with business objectives and operational realities.

## How OCTAVE Works
OCTAVE is structured into three main phases, each with specific processes:

**Phase 1: Build Asset-Based Threat Profiles**
- The analysis team identifies the organization's critical assets—those most important to the mission and business operations.
- Information is gathered from senior management, operational managers, and staff to capture different perspectives on assets, existing security practices, perceived threats, and vulnerabilities.
- The team creates threat profiles for each critical asset, detailing security requirements and potential threats.

**Phase 2: Identify Infrastructure Vulnerabilities**
- The team maps high-priority assets to the supporting technical infrastructure (hardware, software, networks).
- Vulnerabilities in the infrastructure that could expose critical assets to threats are identified, often through examining data flows, access paths, and system configurations.
- The team evaluates the likelihood and potential impact of these vulnerabilities being exploited.

**Phase 3: Develop Security Strategy and Plans**
- Risks are prioritized based on the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on the organization.
- The team develops actionable mitigation strategies and protection plans for the most significant risks, ensuring resources are directed where they will have the greatest effect.
- The outcome is a risk management strategy tailored to the organization’s unique needs, supporting ongoing improvement.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Focuses on organizational and operational risk, not just technical threats.
- Involves multiple stakeholders for a holistic view.
- Produces prioritized, actionable risk mitigation plans.
