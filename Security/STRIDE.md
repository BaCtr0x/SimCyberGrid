## How STRIDE Works

**STRIDE** is a threat modeling methodology developed by Microsoft to systematically identify potential security threats in a system. The name is an acronym for six categories of threats:

- **S**poofing

- **T**ampering
    
- **R**epudiation
    
- **I**nformation Disclosure
    
- **D**enial of Service
    
- **E**levation of Privilege

STRIDE is typically used in conjunction with Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to map each threat type to specific system components or data flows. For each element in the system (e.g., APIs, databases, authentication mechanisms), analysts consider how each of the six STRIDE threats could manifest and what mitigations are needed.

## Key Features of STRIDE

- Provides a structured, mnemonic-based approach to threat identification    
- Focuses on categorizing threats rather than directly assessing risk
- Often used early in the software development lifecycle
- Can be combined with other models (like DREAD or PASTA) for comprehensive security assessment- Well-suited to teams with a strong understanding of their threat landscape.
