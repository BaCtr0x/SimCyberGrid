## Trusted Boundaries for Threatmodel
### **Existing Trust Boundaries and Descriptions**

#### **1. External Interface Boundary**

**Description:**  
Separates the smart gridâ€™s internal systems from all external entities and services (such as PKI infrastructure, external OCSP responders, and CRL servers).  
**Purpose:**

- Prevents direct access from untrusted external networks.
    
- Enforces strict authentication, authorization, and protocol validation at all ingress/egress points.
    
- Typical controls: firewalls, DMZs, mutual TLS, and API gateways.
    

#### **2. Field Device and Gateway Boundary**

**Description:**  
Encapsulates all field-level devices (SMGWs, DER-Gateways, PMUs, EVSE-Gateways, customer DER/IoT) and their direct communication with grid gateways and controllers.  
**Purpose:**

- Segregates low-level operational technology (OT) assets from higher-level IT and management systems.
    
- Limits lateral movement in the event of device compromise.
    
- Enforces device authentication, secure provisioning, and device-level access control.
    

#### **3. Organizational Domain Boundary**

**Description:**  
Separates systems and data managed by different organizations (e.g., DSO, third-party VPP operator, external service providers).  
**Purpose:**

- Ensures that only authorized, contractually trusted parties can access or control assets across organizational lines.
    
- Enforces inter-domain network segmentation, legal/compliance boundaries, and third-party risk controls.
    

#### **4. IT/OT Convergence Boundary**

**Description:**  
Defines the interface where traditional IT systems (data analytics, SIEM, DSO-DMS, operational data stores) meet operational grid control and automation systems (SCADA, IEDs, microgrid controllers).  
**Purpose:**

- Controls and monitors data exchange between IT and OT networks.
    
- Prevents IT-originated threats (e.g., malware, phishing) from propagating to critical OT assets.
    
- Enforces protocol translation, deep packet inspection, and strict change management.
    

### **Are Any Trust Boundaries Missing?**

Your model covers the most critical trust boundaries for a German smart grid in the middle and low voltage sector. However, for completeness and alignment with BSI, FNN, and IEC 62443 recommendations, consider whether these additional boundaries are needed:

#### **A. Customer Premises Boundary**

**Description:**  
Separates utility-managed infrastructure (e.g., SMGW, grid-side DER-Gateway) from customer-owned devices and networks (e.g., home automation, private DER/IoT).  
**Purpose:**

- Prevents customer devices from directly accessing grid control systems.
    
- Enforces separation of responsibilities and liability.
    
- Controls HAN (Home Area Network) integration points.
    

**Recommendation:**  
If customer-side devices (beyond DER/IoT) are in scope, add this boundary to clarify legal and operational separation.

#### **B. Maintenance/Update Boundary**

**Description:**  
Encapsulates remote maintenance/update servers and their privileged connections to field devices.  
**Purpose:**

- Limits the blast radius of a compromised update server.
    
- Enforces code signing, update validation, and audit logging at the trust boundary.
    

**Recommendation:**  
If remote update flows are highly privileged or cross organizational lines, consider modeling this as a distinct boundary.

### **Summary Table**

| Trust Boundary Name         | Description                                                       | Present in Model? |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| External Interface Boundary | Separates internal grid from external networks and PKI services   | Yes               |
| Field Device and Gateway    | Segregates field/edge devices from core grid and IT/OT systems    | Yes               |
| Organizational Domain       | Divides DSO, VPP, and third-party domains                         | Yes               |
| IT/OT Convergence           | Controls data flow between business IT and operational OT systems | Yes               |
| Customer Premises           | Separates utility and customer-owned networks/devices             | _Recommended_     |
| Maintenance/Update          | Encapsulates privileged update/maintenance channels               | _Recommended_     |

### **Conclusion**

- **Your model includes all core trust boundaries required by German and international standards for smart grids.**
    
- **For maximum clarity and compliance, consider adding a Customer Premises Boundary and a Maintenance/Update Boundary if your architecture involves direct HAN integration or privileged remote update flows.**
    
- **Descriptions above can be used directly in your Threat Dragon model to document each boundaryâ€™s purpose and rationale.**
