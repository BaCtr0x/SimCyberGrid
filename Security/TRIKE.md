TRIKE is a risk-based, asset-focused threat modeling framework designed to facilitate security auditing and risk management. It emphasizes understanding how users interact with assets and assigning risk values to potential threats, helping organizations prioritize mitigation efforts
## How TRIKE Works
TRIKE’s process is typically divided into two main models:

**1. Requirements Model**
- The team defines system assets (data, processes, resources) and identifies all actors (users, systems) that interact with those assets.
- Acceptable risk levels are established for each asset, reflecting the organization’s risk tolerance and business needs.
- This model provides a framework for discussing and agreeing on risk across stakeholders.

**2. Implementation Model**
- The system is represented using Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), showing how data moves through the system and what actions users can perform.
- An actor-asset-action matrix is created, mapping each actor’s possible actions (create, read, update, delete) on every asset.
- For each interaction, the team identifies potential threats and assigns risk values, considering both the likelihood and impact of each threat.
- Automated tools may be used to generate attack graphs and enumerate possible threats based on the model.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Highly asset-centric: every threat is analyzed in the context of a specific asset and user action.
- Risk-based: threats are prioritized according to risk values, ensuring focus on the most critical issues.
- Facilitates communication and collaboration among stakeholders.
- Well-suited for organizations seeking a detailed, systematic approach to risk management at the system level.
