The IEC 61850 standard was a response to the growing need for higher and deeper levels of control and automation in electrical grids. With steadily increasing numbers of devices, device types and data points, further accelerated by digitization, as well as the integration of new, often geographically distributed and heteregenous, generation sources, it became evident that future demands could not be met with the technological limits of serial protocols like Modbus. 

In order to guarantee interoperability in the face of rapid technological development and product innovation in the industry, the IEC 61850 standard not only defines various communication protocols and interfaces, but also provides specifications concerning the substation modelling, configuration language and data models. For this reason, IEC 61850 is commonly referred to as “not just a protocol” and often called a data model or framework instead. 

The scope of the standard allows to map the standardized data models and services onto serveral communication protocols and thus transfer the data via Ethernet using different protocols for different requirements and applications, as for example TCP/IP-based protocols for clients/server communications. For this reason, despite its initial focus on substation automation, the flexibility of IEC 61850 has spread its use to other applications, such as the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the power system or the communication between intelligent devices in Building Management Systems (BMS).

The IEC 61850 standard distinguishes itself through the following elements:

## Abstract Communication Service Interface (ACSI)
The ACSI (defined in IEC 61850–7‑2) describes the functions and services for the interaction between IEDs in the system. Examples of IEC 61850 services include the transmission of files, reading of data or assignition of values. The ACSI can be mapped onto various protocols, including MMS or web services.

## System Design and Structure
The functions of the IEC 61850 standard are the often-heard _logical nodes_, which can simply contain device descriptions but usually represent a real physical device like switches, sensors or IEDs, and its entire range of functionalies.

## IEC 61850 Protocol Suite
The IEC 61850 standard defines several different protocols for different purposes in substations and other facilities/ utilities.  
The standard defines the low-level (process bus) client/server based **GOOSE/GSSE** (Generic Object Oriented Substation Events) protocol to transmit event data across networks at very high speeds. This enables to new possibilities for advanced substation automation and protection functions and schemes.

It also defines the more complex **MMS** (manufacturing message specification) protocol for communications between servers and clients. It provides a set of functions that allows the client to obtain the data model of the server, read or modify individual values, or even delete entries as well as to transfer files.

The last two protocols displayed on the chart comprise the **Sampled Values (SV)** protocol for the transmission of digitized instantaneous **values** of power system quantities, mainly primary currents and voltages and time synchronization protocols such as **SNTP** over UDP/IP.
