### Definition:
**COSEM** is the **object model** used with [[DLMS]] to structure metering data. It defines how **information is organized and represented** in a meter or device.

### Key Components:
- Uses **OBIS codes** (Object Identification System) to define data points (e.g., energy, voltage, time).
- Data is modeled as **objects** with attributes and methods.

### Together with DLMS:
- **DLMS/COSEM** is often referred to as a single protocol stack.
- DLMS provides the messaging mechanics.
- COSEM defines the structure and semantics of the data being transmitted.
