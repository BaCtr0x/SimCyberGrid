| Business      | The business layer represents the business view on the information exchange related to smart grids. SGAM can be used to map regulatory and economic (market) structures (using harmonized roles and responsibilities) and policies, business models and use cases, business portfolios (products & services) of market parties involved. Also business capabilities, use cases and business processes can be represented in this layer. |
| Function      | The function layer describes systems use cases, functions and services including their relationships from an architectural viewpoint. The functions are represented independent from actors and physical implementations in applications, systems and components. The functions are derived by extracting the use cases functionalities that is independent from actors.                                                                |
| Information   | The information layer describes the information that is being used and exchanged between functions, services and components. It contains information objects and the underlying canonical data models. These objects represent the common semantics for functions and services in order to allow an interoperable information exchange via communication means.                                                                         |
| Communication | The emphasis of the communication layer is to describe protocols and mechanisms for the interoperable exchange of information between components in the context of the underlying use case, function or service and related information objects or data models.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Component     | The emphasis of the component layer is the physical distribution of all participating component in the smart grid context. This includes system & decide actors, power system equipment (typically located at process and field level), protection and telecontrol devices, network infrastructure (wires / wireless communication connections, routers, switches, servers) and any kind of computers.                                  |
