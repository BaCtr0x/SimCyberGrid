### Definition:  
RBAC is an **access control model** that restricts system access based on the roles of individual users within an organization. Instead of assigning permissions directly to users, permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned roles.

### Key Concepts:
- **Role**: A named collection of permissions (e.g., “Operator”, “Admin”, “Auditor”).
- **User**: Assigned one or more roles.
- **Permission**: Access rights to perform actions on resources.

### Benefits:
- Easier permission management.
- Supports **least privilege** and **separation of duties**.
- Scalable in large systems (e.g., SCADA, cloud environments, enterprise networks).
