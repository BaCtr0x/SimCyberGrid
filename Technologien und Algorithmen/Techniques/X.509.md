### Definition:
**X.509** is a widely used **standard for public key certificates**, defined by the ITU-T. It forms the backbone of **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)** systems, enabling secure authentication, encryption, and digital signatures.

### Key Features:
- Certificates bind a **public key** to an **identity** (e.g., a device, person, or organization).
- Includes fields like **Subject**, **Issuer**, **Validity Period**, and the **public key**.
- Digitally signed by a **Certificate Authority (CA)** to ensure authenticity and integrity.
- Supports certificate chaining and trust hierarchies.

### Use Cases:
- [[TLS]]/SSL (HTTPS)
- Secure email (S/MIME)
- VPNs, code signing, smart grid comms (e.g., ISO 15118, IEC 62351)
