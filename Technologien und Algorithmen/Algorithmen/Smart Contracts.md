 In kurz ist es eine Menge an Versprechen, die in einer digitalen Form festgehalten werden, inklusive Protokolle, in denen die Beteiligten agieren koennen.

### Definition
A **smart contract** is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain that runs when predefined conditions are met. It enables decentralized and automated execution of agreements without intermediaries.

### Characteristics:
- **Decentralized Execution:** Runs on a blockchain network without a central authority.
- **Immutable:** Once deployed, it cannot be altered, ensuring trust.
- **Self-verifying & Self-executing:** Automatically enforces contract terms when conditions are met.
- **Transparent:** Code and transactions are visible on the blockchain.
- **Tamper-proof:** Protected by cryptographic hashing.

### Mode of Operation
- **Deployment:** Written in blockchain-specific languages (e.g., Solidity for Ethereum) and deployed on a blockchain.
- **Trigger Event:** External transactions or oracles initiate contract execution.
- **Execution:** Code runs and updates blockchain state (e.g., transferring assets).

### Security Risks & Challenges
- **Code Vulnerabilities:** Bugs (e.g., reentrancy, integer overflow) can lead to exploits.
- **Private Key Security:** Unauthorized access can lead to contract manipulation.
- **Oracle Manipulation:** External data sources (oracles) can be attacked.
- **Gas Limit & Denial-of-Service (DoS):** High gas consumption can halt execution.
- **Upgradability Issues:** Immutable contracts require careful design for updates.
