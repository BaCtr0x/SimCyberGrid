A PLC is a rugged industrial computer designed to automate physical processes in real-world systems like manufacturing lines, power plants, water traemtent facilities, etc.

## Core Functions:
- Monitor inputs (sensors, switches)
- Executes control logic
- Sets outputs (relays, motors, valves)

## Programming
- Written in ladder logic, function blocks, or structured text
- Logic is deterministic: scan inputs $\rightarrow$ execute logic $\rightarrow$ update outputs (cyclically)

## interfaces:
- Connected via industrial protocols (e.g. [[Modbus]], Profinet EtherNet/IP, S7Comm)
