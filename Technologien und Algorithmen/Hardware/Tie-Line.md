A tie-line (also called an intertie) is a transmission line that connects two separate power systems or regions - for example, two utility grids or different areas within a large power grid.

## Purpose of a Tie-Line
- Transfer electricity between regions to balance supply and demand
-  Improve reliability by allowing power sharing during outages or shortages
-  Enable frequency regulation and synchronization between interconnected grids
-  Support electricity trading between markets and utility companies

## In Attacks
In attacks like the Resonance Attack, tie-line signals can be manipulated to affect power flow and grid frequency - causing instability or even blackouts.
