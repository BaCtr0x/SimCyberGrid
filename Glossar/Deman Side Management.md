*Demand Side Management (DSM)* or Load Management has been used by the power industry over the last thirty years with the aim to reduce energy consumption and improve overall electricity usage efficiency through the implementation of policies and methods that control electricity demand. Demand Side Management (DSM) is usually a task for power companies / utilities to reduce or remove peak load, hence defer the installations of new capacities and distribution facilities. The commonly used methods by utilities for demand side management are: combination of high efficiency generation units, peak-load shaving, load shifting, and operating practices facilitating efficient usage of electricity, etc. DSM is therefore characterized by a ‘top down’ approach: the utility decides to implement measures on the demand side to increase its efficiency.
