### THINK
Demand Response are the changes in electric usage implemented directly or indirectly by end-use customers/prosumers from their current/normal consumption/injection patterns in response to certain signals.

### EURELECTRIC
*Demand Response (DR)*, on the contrary, implies a ‘bottom-up’ approach: customers become active in managing their consumption – in order to achieve efficiency gains and thus reap monetary/economic benefits. Demand Response (DR) can be defined as the changes in electric usage by end-use customers from their normal consumption patterns in response to changes in the price of electricity over time. Further, DR can be also defined as the incentive payments designed to induce lower electricity use at times of high wholesale market prices or when system reliability is jeopardized. DR includes all intentional modifications to consumption patterns of electricity of end use customers that are intended to alter the timing, level of instantaneous demand, or the total electricity consumption. DR aims to reduce electricity consumption in times of high energy cost or network constraints by allowing customers to respond to price or quantity signals.
